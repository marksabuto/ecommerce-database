# E-commerce Database Design Decisions

## Database Architecture Overview
The e-commerce database is designed to support a flexible and scalable product catalog system with the following key features:
- Product categorization and hierarchy
- Brand management
- Product variations (colors, sizes)
- Product attributes and specifications
- Inventory management
- Product images

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Product Structure
- **Separated Product and Product Item**: 
  - `product` table stores base product information
  - `product_item` table handles individual SKUs and inventory
  - This separation allows for better inventory management and variation handling

### 2. Category System
- **Hierarchical Categories**:
  - Implemented using self-referencing foreign key in `product_category`
  - Allows for unlimited category depth
  - Enables flexible product organization

### 3. Product Variations
- **Flexible Variation System**:
  - Separate tables for colors and sizes
  - Junction tables (`item_color`, `item_size`) for many-to-many relationships
  - Supports multiple variation types through `product_variation` table

### 4. Attributes System
- **Dynamic Attributes**:
  - Generic attribute system using `attribute_type` and `attribute_category`
  - Supports different data types (text, number, boolean, date)
  - Allows for product-specific attributes without schema changes

### 5. Image Management
- **Flexible Image System**:
  - Supports multiple images per product
  - Primary image flag for main product display
  - Can associate images with specific product items

### 6. Data Integrity
- **Cascading Deletes**:
  - Implemented where appropriate (e.g., product deletion cascades to variations)
  - Prevents orphaned records
  - Maintains data consistency

### 7. Timestamps
- **Automatic Timestamps**:
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` fields on relevant tables
  - Automatic updates using MySQL triggers
  - Helps with auditing and tracking changes

## Future Considerations
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Indexing strategy for frequently queried fields
   - Query optimization for complex product searches
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed data

2. **Scalability**:
   - Partitioning strategy for large tables
   - Read replicas for reporting
   - Sharding considerations for high-volume systems

3. **Feature Extensions**:
   - Support for product bundles
   - Advanced pricing rules
   - Multi-currency support
   - Product reviews and ratings
